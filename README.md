UC Berkeley CS188 (Artificial Intelligence) project:

•	Designed a Pacman variation game where Pacman hunts ghosts using a Bayesian framework <br/>
•	Utilized a Bayes Net structure where Pacman is related to ghosts based on noisy Manhattan distances, and can then use those noisy distances to infer probabilistically where the ghosts are <br/>
•	Created a Hidden Markov Model for ghosts’ time sensitive location changes to better help Pacman hunt them
